# tech-hints
Unordered list of miscellaneous technical hints (will be enriched from time to time)

## Bash & unix

- [File and directory encryption on linux](linux_encryption.md)
- [Steal the stdout of a running process](linux_steal_other_process_terminal_stdout) (actually its associated terminal)
- [Bash virtual files: redirect the output of a command to a fresh temporary file in one command](bash_virtual_file.md)
- Did you know that a .bashrc init file is supposed to [remain silent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12440287/scp-doesnt-work-when-echo-in-bashrc) ?
- [dwdiff: colored diff at the word level, you may specify the delimiters](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dwdiff) (apparently better than wdiff)
- [pv: pipe viewer, to debug pipe traffic](https://catonmat.net/unix-utilities-pipe-viewer)
- 'truncate -s 4G dummy' creates a big dummy file. (truncate does not only truncate).

## Window Manager

- [Command-line to operate on linux desktop windows (interaction with the linux window manager)](wm_command_line_operations.md)

## HTML, CSS

- [Mitigate CSS lack of priorities](css_priority.md) 

## Other

- [Export all sheets of excel or libreoffice calc file](exportcsv.md) ..because usually, you can only export one sheet at a time.
